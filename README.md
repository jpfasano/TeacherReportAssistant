# Teacher Report Tool
This tool (TRT) is to assist teachers when writing individualized comments for each student by using sentence templates that when selected are filled in with the student name and correct gender pronouns. 
The tool iterates through the students and allows the teacher to click on the appropriate sentences for each student.
