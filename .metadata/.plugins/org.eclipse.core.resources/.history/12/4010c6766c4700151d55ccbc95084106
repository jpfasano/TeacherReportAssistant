<h1>Teacher Report Tool</h1>
<p>
This tool (TRT) is to assist teachers when writing individualized comments for each student by using 
sentence templates that when selected are filled in with the student name and correct gender pronouns. 
The tool iterates through the students and allows the teacher to click on the appropriate sentences for each student.

<p>
The input files are: 

<ul>
<li>names.trn:&nbsp;&nbsp Contains student names with their gender.</li>
<li>sentenceTemplates.trs:&nbsp;&nbsp Contains sentence templates to be used in the student report</li>
</ul>

From the menu bar select 
<ul>
<li><em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Open student names&hellip;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp to specify a *.trn file, and then </li>
<li><em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Open sentence templates&hellip;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp to specify a *.trs file.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Input File Formats</h2>
<h3>names.trn</h3>
<p>
This file contains the name and gender of each student, one student per line.&nbsp;&nbsp
The first character of each line is M or F to indicate male or female.&nbsp;&nbsp
The students name follows this initial character.&nbsp;&nbsp
Here is an example:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  M Donald Duck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  F Minnie Mouse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  M Bugs Bunnie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  F Flipper<br>
</code>
</p>
<h3>sentenceTemplates.trs</h3>
<p>
This file contains the sentence templates.  All occurrences of <em>_NAME</em> in a template are replaced with the student's name.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Similarly, any occurrence of <em>_HE</em>, <em>_HIM</em>, and <em>_HIS</em> are replaced with the gender appropriate pronoun.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, _SON is replaced with son or daughter as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
The sentence templates are in categories.  Example categories might be:
<ul>
<li>Current Performance</li>
<li>Class Work</li>
<li>Homework</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
A new category is indicated by a line that begins with &quot;.  
Here is an example:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Current Performance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _NAME is do extremely well.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _NAME is not performing to _HIS potential.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Class Work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _HIS classwork is always excellent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _NAME is not always focused so _HIS classwork suffers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Homework<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is obvious that _NAME takes great pride in _HIS homework.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Too often _NAME has not completed _HIS homework.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Conclusion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is a pleasure having _NAME in class. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _NAME should seek extra help to improve _HIS current grade.<br>
