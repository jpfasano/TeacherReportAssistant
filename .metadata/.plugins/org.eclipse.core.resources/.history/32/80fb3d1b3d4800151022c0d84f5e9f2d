<h1>Teacher Report Tool</h1>

<p>This tool (TRT) is to assist teachers when writing individualized comments for each student by using sentence templates that when selected are filled in with the student name and correct gender pronouns. The tool iterates through the students and allows the teacher to click on the appropriate sentences for each student.</p>

<p>Fig. 1: Image of Teacher Report Tool</p>

<p>There are two required&nbsp;input files:</p>

<ul>
    <li>names.trn:&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains student names with their gender.</li>
    <li>sentenceTemplates.trs:&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains sentence templates to be used in the student report</li>
</ul>

<p>To get started from the menu bar select:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Open student names&hellip;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; to specify a *.trn file, and then</li>
    <li><em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Open sentence templates&hellip;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; to specify a *.trs file.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Input File Formats</h2>

<h3>names.trn</h3>

<p>This file contains the name and gender of each student, one student per line.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first character of each line is M or F to indicate male or female.&nbsp;&nbsp; The students name follows this initial character.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an example:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; M Donald Duck<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F Minnie Mouse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; M Bugs Bunnie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F Flipper</code></p>

<h3>sentenceTemplates.trs</h3>

<p>This file contains the sentence templates. All occurrences of <em>_NAME</em> in a template are replaced with the student&#39;s name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, any occurrence of <em>_HE</em>, <em>_HIM</em>, and <em>_HIS</em> are replaced with the gender appropriate pronoun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, _SON is replaced with son or daughter as appropriate.</p>

<p>The sentence templates are in categories. Example categories might be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Current Performance</li>
    <li>Class Work</li>
    <li>Homework</li>
    <li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>

<p>A new category is indicated by a line that begins with &quot;. Here is an example of a file sentence template file:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Current Performance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; _NAME is do extremely well.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; _NAME is not performing to _HIS potential.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Class Work<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; _HIS classwork is always excellent.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; _NAME is not always focused so _HIS classwork suffers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Homework<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious that _NAME takes great pride in _HIS homework.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too often _NAME has not completed _HIS homework.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Conclusion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a pleasure having _NAME in class.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; _NAME should seek extra help to improve _HIS current grade.</code><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Open Both Input Files with One Operation</h3>

<p>If both input files have the same name except for the extension, then they can simultaneously be opened using the <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Open both files&hellip;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of how the files would be named to use this option is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>precalculus.trn</li>
    <li>precalculus.trs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating Reports</h2>

<p>There are left and right arrows to advance to the next student or return to a prior student.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a tab for each category of comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the tabbed pane select the desired comments to be included in the report.&nbsp;&nbsp; The student reports are editable on the window.</p>

<h2>Saving the Reports</h2>

<p>From the menu bar select <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Save as&hellip;</em> to specify the file to be written with all student reports.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, the report text can be copied from the editable text window and then pasted into another document.</p>

<h2>A Typical Usage&nbsp;Scenario</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Create a file containing student names and genders. &nbsp;Call this file something like precalculus.trn. &nbsp;Be sure the file extension is .trn.</li>
    <li>Create a file containing categories and sentence templates. &nbsp;Use the same file name as the prior step, but use the extension .trs. The two input files should be stored in the same directory.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Run TeacherReportTool by:
    <ul>
        <li>double clicking on the file TeacherReportTool.jar&nbsp;<br />
        or</li>
        <li>in a command window run <code>java -jar TeacherReportTool.jar</code>. &nbsp;You may have to include the path to the java executable and TeacherReportTool.jar.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>From the menubar select&nbsp;<br />
    <img alt="Open Files" src="_IMAGE2" /></li>
    <li>Select the *.trn file created in the first step. &nbsp;Since the two input files have the same name with the different extensions *.trn and *.trs, and because they are in the same directory, both files will be opened simultaneously.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Notice the first student&#39;s name and gender is displayed below the menu bar along with the sentence templates for the first category of sentences. &nbsp;Click on the check box for any&nbsp;sentences you would like to include in this student&#39;s report.<br />
    <img alt="Select Sentences from 1st Category" src="_IMAGE3" /></li>
    <li>Click the Apply Button to have the selected sentences moved to the editable student report box..<br />
