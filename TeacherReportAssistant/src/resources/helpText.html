<h1>Teacher Report Assistant</h1>
<p>
This tool (TRA) is to assist teachers when writing comments about their students by using template sentences that when selected are filled in with the student name and correct gender pronouns. 
The input files are: 

<ul>
<li>names.tra</li>
<li>sentenceTemplates.tra</li>
</ul>

From the menu bar select <em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Open directory&hellip;</em> to specify a directory that contains these two files.
</p>
<h2>Input File Formats</h2>
<h3>names.tra</h3>
<p>
This file contains the name and gender of each student, one student per line. 
The first character of each line is M or F to indicate male or female. 
The students name follows this initial character.
Here is an example:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  M Donald Duck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  F Minnie Mouse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  M Bugs Bunnie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  F Flipper<br>
</code>
</p>
<h3>sentenceTemplates.tra</h3>
<p>
This file contains the sentence templates.  Any occurrences of <em>_NAME</em> in the template are replaced with the student's name. 
Similarly, any occurrence of <em>_HE</em>, <em>_HIM</em>, and <em>_HIS</em> are replaced with the gender appropriate pronoun.
</p>
<p>
The sentence templates are in categories.  Example categories might be:
<ul>
<li>Current Performance</li>
<li>Class Work</li>
<li>Homework</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
A new category is indicated by a line that begins with &quot;.  
Here is an example:<br>
<code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Current Performance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _NAME is do extremely well.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _Name is not performing to _HIS potential.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Class Work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _HIS classwork is always excellent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _NAME is not always focused so _HIS classwork suffers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Homework<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is obvious that _NAME takes great pride in _HIS homework.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Too often _NAME has not completed _HIS homework.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &quot;Conclusion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is a pleasure having _NAME in class. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  _NAME should seek extra help to improve _HIS current grade.<br>
</code>
